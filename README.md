# Dynamic Dog Selection App

The project simulates a dog browsing tool, where you can select dog breeds from a dropdown and render an accompanying photo. 

Bootstrapped with Create React App, this app uses Tanstack Query for state managment and data fetching. All data is fetched from the [Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)
